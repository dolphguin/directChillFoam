## INITIAL NOTE  

  This is just a fork from [https://github.com/blebon/directChillFoam](https://github.com/blebon/directChillFoam)
  that I've started for private purposes. Mainly porting the code to other versions,
  testing capabilities & playing around with it, so do not expect any major modification
  from it.

  Just for sake of clarity: There is no official endorsement for this initiative,
  neither from the original authors nor from their supporting institutions. Similarly,
  there is no warranty about the correctness of any material present at this fork,
  so use it only under your own risk!

  Lastly, remember to always keep track of the original authorships

## About OpenFOAM  

  OpenFOAM is a free, open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software
  package released by the OpenFOAM Foundation. It has a large user base across
  most areas of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic
  organisations. OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve anything
  from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat
  transfer, to solid dynamics and electromagnetics.

## Direct-Chill (DC) Casting Application  

  This repository contains developments for modeling direct-chill (DC) casting
  by Bruno Lebon at BCAST, Brunel University London using OpenFOAM.

  This work includes a solver based on the continuum mixture theory taken from:

  W.D. Bennon and F.P. Incropera, "A continuum model for momentum, heat and
  species transport in binary solid-liquid phase change systems - 1. Model
  formulation", IJHMT **30** (1987) 2161-2170.

  as well as tutorial cases from:
